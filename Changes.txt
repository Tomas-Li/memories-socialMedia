Changes over the original code:

-styles files were changed to use the MUI V5 features (mainly based on sx and using @emotions over JS object structures)

-Google Login was changed to use the new Identity services over the old OAuth service. I didn't use a package, I based the code on the official documentation and wrote it over it.

-Inside the store I have the auth->authData which is always refering to the user localy saved (the reducer saves and deletes the localStorage, while updating the entry). Instead of following the video and doing multiple calls to read the storage, I should just read the state.

-Router was updated and there is no more <Redirect /> component (changed for <Navigate />)

-Aesthetic changes (background, some colors, icon?)

-Added a tag collection to the db so that I could exchange <ChipInput/> to <Autocomplete /> (and to give an actual feedback when searching through tags)

-ButtonBase wroke my post element, so I changed to a Link element from react-router-dom and instead of using a function to redirect myself, I use a dynamic string inside this element. BTW I enclosed the element inside a Box container to apply styles to all the childs and only wrapped the paperMedia component inside the Link (it was broking the edit functions)
